Hi there! Thank you for installing Clojure Sublimed.

A few important points to help you get started:

- Assign `Clojure (Sublimed)` syntax to your Clojure files: `View` → `Syntax` → `Open all with current extension as...` → `Clojure Sublimed` → `Clojure (Sublimed)` (this step is required for everything else to work)
- Make sure you have nREPL version 0.8+
- Connect using `Clojure Sublimed: Connect`
- Configure key bindings using `Preferences: Clojure Sublimed Key Bindings`
