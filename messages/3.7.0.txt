New feature in Clojure Sublimed: Watches!

Watches are great alternative to debug prints: they allow you to monitor intermediate values during function execution right in the editor.

This is how they work:

- Select a right-hand expression
- Run `Clojure Sublimed: Add Watch` command
- Now every time function is executed, for any reason, watched expressions will display values they evaluate to, in real time.

For now watches are only supported in Socket REPL.

Enjoy!
